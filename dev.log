Development log

Monday, Jan 22nd
----------------
Picked up from where I left a week ago:
- Servo control is working, but the pan servo is aligned off to the side.
- Attachment plate for the lidar<->servo connection needs to be designed,
  it's more trouble than worth to rig something temporary compared to ordering 3d printed plate.
- Lidar measurements & I2C is untested, circuit schematic created for the wiring.

Decided to focus solely on the Lidar measurements and I2C aspect.
I begun by grounding the unused PWM-pins in the Lidar wiring just in case. I used 12 kohm resistors between the pin and GND.
Could not get any reading from the Lidar - not sure if the measurement should be visible laser but if so, the whole
measurement is not working at all. Tried using the I2C for reading, but didn't really measure I2C properly for it.

I'm still missing the recommended 680uF capacitor between 5V and GND, will have to scrounge older projects for the capacitor.
