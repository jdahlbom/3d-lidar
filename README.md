3D lidar project
================

This is long work in progress project aiming to create a dome-like scanning lidar
implementation.

Current components are Garmin Lidar LITE v3 and Sparkfuns cheap pan-tilt brackets + servos.
Assuming I can produce useful distance point clouds with this setup, I might
next update the servo parts to something better. 

See [dev.log](./dev.log) for development notes.
